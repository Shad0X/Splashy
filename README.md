# Splashy

Unity version: 2019.4.12f1

Uses DOTween (free version)

Should be working on PC and Mobile.

Controlls:
    - Press and hold Left Mouse button (or touch screen) 
    - Move around input device to move Ball left / right on the screen

Very simple copy of https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splashy/id1319500389 gameplay without any of the extra content apart from playing through randomly generated levels from start to finish while gaining points for every platform touched. Far from perfect. 

Main goal of this project was to try out DOTween.
